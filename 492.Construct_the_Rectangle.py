# 492. Construct the Rectangle
# Easy
# Topics
# Companies
# Hint
#
# A web developer needs to know how to design a web page's size.
# So, given a specific rectangular web pageâ€™s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:
#
#       The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.
#       The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.
#       The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.
#
# Return an array [L, W] where L and W are the length and width of the web page you designed in sequence.
#
#  
#
# Example 1:
#
#       Input: area = 4
#       Output: [2,2]
#       Explanation: The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1]. 
#       But according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3,  [4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2].
#       So the length L is 2, and the width W is 2.
#
# Example 2:
#
#       Input: area = 37
#       Output: [37,1]
#
# Example 3:
#
#       Input: area = 122122
#       Output: [427,286]
#
#  
#
# Constraints:
#
#       1 <= area <= 10^7
